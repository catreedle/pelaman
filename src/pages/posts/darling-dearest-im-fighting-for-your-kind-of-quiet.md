<!-- The title of this post is taken from one of my favorite stories, Tired Tired Sea(it's on AO3). No context, just really beautiful words.

I think I'll try to write something as a tribute, to anyone who have shared part of themselves, online, on paper, or tied to a melody. It's a brave thing to do, to share your stories, your struggles, your accomplishments, your creations, to show your weakness. Thank you. You are such an inspiration, every single one of you.

I am not strong enough to do that. I once came to the point of needing to erase my past presence on social media. At that point I also cut ties with all my friends. The only friends I got were the ones I met online from a burner account while I hid behind anonymosity, _the irony_. I am thankful of them tho, really nice people.

Things have gotten better since then, I reconnect with some of my friends. -->
